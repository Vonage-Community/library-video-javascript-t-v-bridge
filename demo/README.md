# T to V Bridge demo

To get the demo working:

Set `TWILIO_TOKEN`, `VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID`, `VONAGE_SESSION_ID`, `VONAGE_TOKEN` with their values in `script.js`.

To generate the Vonage variables, you can use the [Video API Playground](https://tools.vonage.com/video/playground).

You'll be able to switch between the libraries by commenting and uncommenting their respective script tags.

> Note: There is a devDependency in the project that is only necessary to run the demo on StackBlitz. If you download the code, you should be able to just open the index.html file in a browser to see it working.
